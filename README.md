The technologies and tools I used while developing this project are

- **Flutter**: A powerful UI toolkit for developing natively compiled applications across mobile, web, and desktop platforms using a single codebase. Flutter offers a rich set of pre-designed widgets and a fast development experience with its hot-reload feature.
- **Dart**:The programming language that powers Flutter applications. Dart is optimized for building fast, scalable apps across multiple platforms and provides strong typing, async support, and modern syntax.
- **BLoC (Business Logic Component)**: A design pattern and state management solution that helps keep the business logic of an application separate from its presentation layer. By using BLoC, the app maintains a clean architecture, making the code more testable, scalable, and easier to maintain
- **FIGMA**: A collaborative design tool used to create the app's user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) before implementation. Figma helps visualize the appâ€™s layout and interactions, ensuring consistency and improving the overall design workflow.
- **MONGO DB**: A NoSQL database used to store application data efficiently. It offers scalability, flexibility, and high performance for handling structured and unstructured data.
- **Node js**:A backend runtime environment that enables building scalable and efficient server-side applications. It handles API requests, database interactions, and real-time communication.
